# auto-ender mod [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mladjo97/auto-ender.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mladjo97/auto-ender) [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)
Mod for Software Inc. game which allows you to auto-end the design and development phase of a project.

## Description
It will skip the design and development phase of a project if it is a contract and has code and art units as soon as they are fullfilled, so you don't waste time and money.
It allows you to speed-up the initial phase of the game where you only work on contracts or even build a highly efficient outsourcing company.
*Note: it won't skip the bug fixing phase, that is left up to you to decide when to stop.*

## Install notes
Download a stable release from [here](https://github.com/mladjo97/auto-ender/releases) and copy the mod folder to the *DLLMods* folder.

**Note**: Make sure you have a folder named *DLLMods* in your game installation directory.

**Note *again***: If you have any problems with loading the actual mod in the game options, open the console and type *RELOAD_DLL_MOD*
